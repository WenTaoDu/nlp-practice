## General Instructions
#### Setup
You will need to provision a [Linux data science virtual machine (DSVM)](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/microsoft-ads.linux-data-science-vm?tab=Overview). After the machine is provisioned, you will need to login (ssh) into your machine using a client software such as Plink (see below), download the [setup shell script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/Azure-MachineLearning-DataScience/master/Misc/StrataSanJose2017/Scripts/DSVM_Customization_Script.sh), and run it using the following commands:
chmod +x DSVM_Customization_Script.sh
./DSVM_Customization_Script.sh

The above steps will setup your DSVM. After which you can following the remaining steps of the tutorial. 

#### Running R scripts on Linux DSVM
As explained below, you can login (using web-browser) to the R-studio server on the DSVM and run the R scripts which are provided [here](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-MachineLearning-DataScience/tree/master/Misc/StrataSanJose2017/Code). These R-scripts, along with the necessary data will be already loaded on your machine by running the setup shell script above. If R scripts are in markdown files, then you can click on "Knit" near the top of your R-studio browser window.


## REQUIRED - Tutorial Prerequisites
* Please bring a wireless enabled laptop.
* Make sure your machine has an ssh client with port-forwarding capability. On Mac or Linux, simply run the ssh command in a terminal window.
On Windows, download [plink.exe](https://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/x86/plink.exe)
from http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html.

## Connecting to the Data Science Virtual Machine (with Spark 2.0.2) on Microsoft Azure
We will provide Azure Data Science Virtual Machines (running Spark 2.0.2) for attendees to use during the tutorial. You will use your laptop to connect to your allocated virtual machine.

* Command line to connect with ssh (Linux, Mac) - replace XXX with the DNS address of your Data Science Virtual Machine [e.g. strataABC.westus.cloudapp.azure.com]
```bash
ssh -L localhost:8787:localhost:8787 -L localhost:8088:localhost:8088 remoteuser@XXX
```
* Command line to connect with plink.exe (Windows) - run the following commands in a Windows command prompt window - replace XXX with the DNS address of your Data Science Virtual Machine [e.g. strataABC.westus.cloudapp.azure.com]
```bash
cd directory-containing-plink.exe
.\plink.exe -L localhost:8787:localhost:8787 -L localhost:8088:localhost:8088 remoteuser@XXX
```
* After connecting via the above command lines, open [http://localhost:8787/](http://localhost:8787/) in your web browser to connect to RStudio Server on your Data Science Virtual Machine<br>
<b>NOTE: During the tutorial, all attendees will use RStudio Server on their Data Science Virtual Machines.</b>

## Datasets used in this tutorial

### The 2013 New York City Taxi and Fare dataset (used in SparkR and sparklyr samples)
The NYC Taxi Trip data is about 20 GB of compressed comma-separated values (CSV) files (~48 GB uncompressed), comprising more than 173 million individual trips and the fares paid for each trip. Each trip record includes the pick up and drop-off location and time, anonymized hack (driver's) license number and medallion (taxiâ€™s unique id) number. The data covers all trips in the year 2013 and is provided in the following two datasets for each month: 
* The 'trip_data' CSV files contain trip details, such as number of passengers, pick up and dropoff points, trip duration, and trip length.
* The 'trip_fare' CSV files contain details of the fare paid for each trip, such as payment type, fare amount, surcharge and taxes, tips and tolls, and the total amount paid.

For hands-on exercises, attendees will use the data from 1 month of 2013, namely December (about 1/10th of the full 2013 data)

<b>The learning problem:</b> To predict the amount of tip paid for a taxi trip (target), based on features such as trip distance, fare amount, number of passengers, time of pickup etc.

## Platforms & services for hands-on exercises or demos
### Azure Linux DSVM (Data Science Virtual Machine)
Information on Linux DSVM: https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/microsoft-ads.linux-data-science-vm<br>
The Linux DSVM has Spark (2.0.2) installed, as well as Yarn for job management, as well as HDFS. So, you can use the DSVM to run regular R code as well as code that run on Spark (e.g. using SparkR package). You will use DSVM as a single node Spark machine for hands-on exercises. We will provision these machines and assign them to you at the beginning of the tutorial.<br>

### Azure HDInsight Spark clusters
Information about HDInsight Spark clusters: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/hdinsight/hdinsight-apache-spark-overview<br>
For this tutorial, we will show how to scale the code you develop in DSVM using HDInsight clusters.
