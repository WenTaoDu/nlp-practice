## If you train on the nyTimes, you'll sound like the nyTimes.
*nlp-corpus* is a proud series of texts from a delicious smattering of sources - aimed at getting cosmopolitan flavours of english - highbrow, lowbrow and unibrow -
dialects, typos, shakespearean, unicode, indian, 19th century, aggressive emoji, and epic nsfw slurs into your training data.

it's role is mainly to kick the tires a bit, as creatively as possible, for linguistic decision-making.

* campy *Friends* tv-show transcripts
* suggestive American rock lyrics - 70s/80s/90s
* Singaporean SMS message corpus
* vulnerable drug-trip reports from Erowid
* State of the union logorrhea
* generically-offensive 90's rap
* Legal descriptions in NAFTA
* 20th century romantic fiction
* pedantic arguments of Wikipedia editors

# Some details
These texts were found just clicking around on the internet.
Running them through your parser should be considered fair-use, but please don't commercially republish them, or anything dumb like that.

for each given source, you can call `.random()`, `.array()`, or `.all()`

for a large join of all the text, call:
```js
let large = corpus.all()
// large.split(' ').length (1.5m words)
```
or to create a corpus of a specified length
```js
let str = corpus.generate(20000).join('\n')//20k words
```
