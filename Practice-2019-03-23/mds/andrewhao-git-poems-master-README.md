git-poems
---

Welcome, poetry archivists! Tonight our objective is to build out the
world's premiere collection of poems, all hosted and stored with Git and
GitHub.

## Exercise 1: Making Changes

Find a typo in this repository. It's there, if you look hard enough.

## Exercise 2: Add the Robert Frost poem, "The Road Not Taken".

Create a new file in `robert_frost_the_road_not_taken.txt`. Fill it in with
the Robert Frost poem.

## Exercise 3: Branches & Pull Requests

Have one group member make a new branch. Call it `more-poetry`.

Fill in the rest of the Emily Dickinson poem, since it's missing much of its text.
Yes, you may use Google.

Push the new branch to GitHub, and on the web site, open a Pull Request
from that branch back to `master`.

Review the changes and when the both of you agree, click "Merge".

Both partners should again synchronize their local repositories.

## Exercise 4: Make a merge conflict happen with a group member

With two cloned versions of this repository, get a merge conflict
happening by editing the 2nd line of the 1st stanza of Emily Dickinson's
*"Hope" is the thing with feathers*. Have both members make their
changes locally and committed.

Have one group member push their change, then have the second group
member synchronize (pull) the change down.

How do you resolve the conflict? Resolve the merge, commit the merge,
then push the merge back up.

## Extra credit: poem sharing!

Add poems to your poem collection! Push the new poems to your
GitHub repository. Be creative, find some of your favorites, or add your own
poetry!

Find other groups and share poems with each others repositories by
opening Pull Requests from your repository to theirs.
