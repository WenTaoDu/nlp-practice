# [_**Navi Corpus**_](http://yoavartzi.com/navi)

**Developed and maintained by** [Yoav Artzi](http://yoavartzi.com). Based on data from Chen and Mooney 2011 and MacMahon et al. 2006.

**It's highly recommended to use the data as available in the [Navi repository](http://yoavartzi.com/navi).**

## Documentations

The corpus includes two version:
1. The original segmented corpus as used by Chen and Mooney in 2011. This data is split into 3 folds for cross-validation over the 3 different maps.
2. The cleaned up Oracle version of the corpus (see Artzi and Zettlemoyer 2013 for details about the cleanup process). This data is divided into two randomly selected sets, one for test and one for training and development. The development set is divided into random splits for cross-validation during development. 

The directory `tacl-data` includes the processed version of the two corpora above in the format used in Artzi and Zettlemoyer 2013. The original SAIL corpus is in the `sail` directory. The directory `navi` includes the development of the Oracle corpus. Finally, the directory `pysrc` includes various utilities.
