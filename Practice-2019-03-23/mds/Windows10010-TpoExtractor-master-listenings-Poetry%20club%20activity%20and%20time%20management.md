Narrator: Listen to a conversation between two students.They are both studying to be English teachers.Girl: Did you register already for your classes next semester?Boy: Yes, I did.Girl: What are you taking?Boy: Um...contemporary literature, English style, um... the teaching seminar, and I still have to do my student teaching.I'm gonna help teach a writing class of the junior high.Girl: That's a heavy schedule.Boy: Yeah, it will be really busy and I'm also taking a theory class.But I have to quit my job a couple of weeks cause it will be just too much.Girl: Where do you work at?Boy: Buster's coffee shop, but just till the end of the month.What are you doing next semester?Girl: Actually a teaching seminar too.And I will have to start writing my thesis.You know, I'm also going for my master's degree.Boy: So you are not writing any poetry, I imagine.Girl: No, I was actually thinking about revising some of my poems and sending them into places for publication.Boy: Cool, you should.Um, did you hear about that new poetry club, The Poetry Kitchen?Girl: Yeah, no time.Boy: It's fun.It's Sunday night.You don't do anything at Sunday nights?Girl: I do homework Sunday nights.Boy: Well, it's only from 7 to 9.Girl: Is it every Sunday?Boy: Last Sunday of every month.I don't know about this month, cause it's probably a little too close to Thanksgiving, so they might move it up.I don't know what they are gonna to do, but it's a good time, it's fun, some really impressive readings.Girl: Who? From our class?Boy: Some people from our class are reading.A lot of them go, sometimes even the professor.Girl: Really? I don't know if I would want to read in front of her.Boy: You wouldn't have to read, you can just watch.I just watched the first time, but it's a good environment to read them, I think anyway.Girl: I probably have to write something new, so maybe during the summer, I just can't now.Boy: Yeah, it wouldn't be the same just reading old stuff.Are you going to do summer school?Girl: Definitely. Otherwise, I will be short 6 credits.I have no choice.Boy: Yeah, me too.This is the second summer.I'll have to take classes.I gotta go now, my Shakespeare class starts in twenty minutes.
