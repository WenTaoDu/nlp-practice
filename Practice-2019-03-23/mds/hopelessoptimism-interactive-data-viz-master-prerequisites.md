## Learning before you Learn (optional but recommended)

This class will assume some basic familiarity with Javascript and the basics of D3.  And the more background you have coming in, the more you will get out of it.

### Setup

First things first, it will be helpful if you have:

- **text editor:** my favorite is [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/2)
- **modern web browser:** my favorite is [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html)
- **HTTP Web Server:**  
  - Unix/OSX should have one by default (`python -m SimpleHTTPServer`).
  - If the `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` command doesn't work on Windows, you will need a server like [Mongoose](http://cesanta.com/mongoose.shtml)

__In [this chapter](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000345/ch04.html) from Scott Murray's book, he walks through in more depth the process of setting up your computer.__

### Prerequisites

Also, you'll be better prepared if you have a basic understanding of the technologies (HTML, CSS, and Javascript) we will be using. YOU DO NOT NEED TO KNOW ANY D3 BEFORE CLASS (this is what we will learn).
