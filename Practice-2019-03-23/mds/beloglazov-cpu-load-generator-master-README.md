# cpu-load-generator â€“ a tool for generating a set of subsequent CPU utilization levels

This tools takes a file as an argument, which lists a set of CPU utilization levels as numbers in
the [0, 100] range representing percentages. The numbers in the file should be separated by new
lines. The tool accepts another parameter specifying the required time interval between two
subsequent CPU utilization levels. Then, cpu-load-generator goes through the sequence of the CPU
utilization levels and generates each CPU utilization level for the specified time interval. The
tool also accepts an optional parameter that sets the number of CPU cores to utilizes, which
defaults to 1.

Internally, to create each CPU utilization level cpu-load-generator calls the `lookbusy` synthetic
load generator developed by Devin Carraway, released under the GPL license, and available from
http://www.devin.com/lookbusy/


## Installation

To use the tool, it is necessary to install the `lookbusy` program first. This can be done using the
included `install-lookbusy.sh` script as follows (the installation requires the sudo password):

```Shell
./install-lookbusy.sh
```


## Usage

```
Usage: python cpu-load-generator.py [options] INTERVAL SOURCE

  Generates a set of subsequent CPU utilization levels read from a file.

  Options:
    -h, --help          show this help message and exit
    -n NCPUS, --ncpus=NCPUS
                        number of CPU cores to utilize [default: 1]

Positional Arguments:
  INTERVAL  interval between subsequent CPU utilization levels in seconds
  SOURCE    source file containing a new line separated list of CPU
              utilization levels specified as numbers in the [0, 100] range
```


## Examples

To generate a sequence of 20%, 90%, and 50% CPU utilization for 20 seconds each on 2 cores using the
`test.data` file, please run:

```Shell
python cpu-load-generator.py -n 2 20 test.data
```
