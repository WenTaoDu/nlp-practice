# NUS MOOC Transacts CORPUS
This is an annotated corpus of discussion forum threads from Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). The annotations are grounded on a pedagogy based discourse framework that codifies 'transactivity' (Berkowitz and Gibbs, 1983) and proposes a taxonomy of interventions.

We also propose inter-annotator agreement measures for a piecewise crowdsourcing annotation task to annotate the forum discussions with our proposed taxonomy of transactive interventions.

However, due to privacy concerns and copyright claimed by MOOC platforms such as Coursera.org, we have encrypted the data. Please email us in order to enter into a data sharing agreement and access the data. Write to: Min-Yen Kan kanmy@comp.nus.edu.sg or raise a github issue with your contact information.
