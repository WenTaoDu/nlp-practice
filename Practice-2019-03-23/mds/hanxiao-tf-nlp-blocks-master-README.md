A collection of frequently-used deep learning blocks I have implemented in Tensorflow. It covers the core tasks in NLP such as embedding, encoding, matching and pooling. All implementations follow a modularized design pattern which I called the "block-design". More details can be found [in my blog post](https://hanxiao.github.io/2018/06/25/4-Encoding-Blocks-You-Need-to-Know-Besides-LSTM-RNN-in-Tensorflow/).

## Contents

### `encode_blocks.py`
A collection of sequence encoding blocks. Input is a sequence with shape of `[B, L, D]`, output is another sequence in `[B, L, D']`, where `B` is batch size, `L` is the length of the sequence and `D` and `D'` are the dimensions.

| Name  | Dependencies| Description | Reference |
| --- | --- |--- |--- |
| `LSTM_encode`| | a fast multi-layer bidirectional LSTM implementation based on [`CudnnLSTM`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/contrib/cudnn_rnn/CudnnLSTM#call). Expect to be 5~10x faster than the standard tf `LSTMCell`. However, it can only run on GPU. | [Tensorflow doc on `CudnnLSTM`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/contrib/cudnn_rnn/CudnnLSTM#call)|
| `TCN_encode` | `Res_DualCNN_encode`| a temporal convolution network described in the paper, basically a multi-layer dilated CNN with special padding to ensure the causality| [An Empirical Evaluation of Generic Convolutional and Recurrent Networks for Sequence Modeling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.01271)|
| `Res_DualCNN_encode` |`CNN_encode`| a sub-block used by `TCN_encode`. It is a two-layer CNN with spatial dropout in-between, then followed by a residual connection and a layer-norm.| [An Empirical Evaluation of Generic Convolutional and Recurrent Networks for Sequence Modeling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.01271)|
| `CNN_encode` | | a standard `conv1d` implementation on `L` axis, with the possibility to set different paddings | [Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/1408.5882)|

### `match_blocks.py`
A collection of sequence matching blocks, aka. attention. Input are two sequnces: `context` in the shape of `[B, L_c, D]`, and `query` in the shape of `[B, L_q, D]`. The output is a sequence has the same length as `context`, i.e. with shape of `[B, L_c, D]`. Each position in the output should encodes the relevance of that position in `context` to the complete `query`.

|`Attentive_match`| |basic attention mechanism with different scoring functions, also supports future blinding.| `additive`: [Neural machine translation by jointly learning to align and translate](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0473); `scaled`: [Attention is all you need](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf)|

### `pool_blocks.py`
A collection of pooling blocks. It fuses/reduces on the time axis `L`. Input is a sequence with shape of `[B, L, D]`, output is in `[B, D]`.

| Name  | Dependencies | Description | Reference |
| --- | --- |--- |--- |
|`SWEM_pool`| | do pooling on the input sequence, supports max/avg. pooling, hierarchical avg. max pooling. | [Baseline Needs More Love: On Simple Word-Embedding-Based Models and Associated Pooling Mechanisms](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.09843) |

There are also some convolution-based pooling blocks build on `SWEM_pool`, but they are for experimental purpose. Thus, I will not list them here.

### `embed_blocks.py`
A collection of positional encoding on the sequence.

| Name  | Dependencies | Description | Reference |

### `mulitask_blocks.py`
A collection of multi-task learning blocks. So far only the "cross-stitch block" is available.

| Name  | Dependencies | Description | Reference |
| --- | --- |--- |--- |

### `nn.py`
A collection of auxiliary functions, e.g. masking, normalizing, slicing.
