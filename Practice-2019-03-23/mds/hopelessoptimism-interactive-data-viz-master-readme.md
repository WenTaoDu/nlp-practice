All of the materials for my interactive data visualization workshops have been moved to [bl.ocks.org](bl.ocks.org).  Please find the workshop of interest in the index below and follow the link to the associated block.

> This repository will serve as a central index for the workshops as well as a repository for all of the datasets used. Data is served off of Github Pages for the relevant blocks
