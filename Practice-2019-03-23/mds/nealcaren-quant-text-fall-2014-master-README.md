There's nothing new about sociologists using text as data. Traditionally, source materials have come from things like primary sources (_e.g._ interviews) or secondary sources (_e.g._ newspapers). Scholars use programs like NVivo or ATLAS.ti to assist them in making sense of the data. Over the last decade, however, researchers from a variety of disciplines have increasingly turned to a more algorithmic analysis of texts. This new focus on the quantitative analysis of text  (along with network analysis and agent based modeling) forms the basis of [computational social science](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2745217/). Not coincidentally, the ability of social scientists to collect text corpuses has also grown over the last decade. This combination of new methods and new sources of data presents a unique opportunity for social scientists to find new answers to old questions and start asking new questions.

The primary learning goal for this course if for students to develop the ability to employ appropriate quantitative textual analysis techniques to a social scientific question. In other words, you should be able to write a publishable paper that involves the quantitative analysis of text. Specifically, I expect that by the end of the semester you will be:  

* Able to collect, store and manipulate data from text files, web pages, and web application programming interfaces (APIs);
* Familiar with the major methods of text analysis;
* Knowledgeable of relevant machine learning techniques;
* Able to apply relevant analytic methods to appropriate social scientific questions.

Between most class meetings you will have to do some combinations of the following things. First, you will be reading contemporary examples of social scientific research that employs the relevant methods. Second, you will be reading code of worked examples. Quite often, this code will be in the form of IPython notebooks. Third, you will have to produce some code yourself. For the first few days, this code will take advantage of the codecademy Python MOOC. After that, you'll be writing your own code that you will either bring to class or email to me ahead of class. Finally, we'll spend the last section of the course working on a pair of studies. For each, you and your partner are responsible for presenting your code and findings.

Half of you grade will be based on the daily homework. They are marked with a **H** on the syllabus.  The other half of your grade is based on the two projects. For each project, you will be expected to present your findings and hand in a well-commented IPython notebook so that someone can replicate your findings. The first project involves an analysis of political emails. The second involves contemporary newspaper data. In both cases, you will develop an interesting sociological puzzle, get/collect the appropriate raw data, and then analyze the data to explore your puzzle. You may work with a partner, but you can't have the same partner. Depending on the flow of the course and student interest, we might end up doing something else for one or both of these projects.

I've put together a [list](http://nealcaren.github.io/python-tutorials/) of online Python tutorials that are accessible to social scientists. You might find some helpful when looking for additional information about a topic.
