# generalisation-example
This is the bot we used for the experiments in our paper on "[Few-shot
Generalisation Across Dialogue Tasks"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.11707).

## Installation
To install all the requirements needed to use this bot, please run:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the bot and experiments
To train any of the individual models, run one of:
- The embedding policy:
```
make train-redp
```
- The keras policy with a binary state featurizer
```
make train-lstm-bin
```
- The keras policy with a label tokenizer state featurizer:
```
make train-lstm-feat
```


To run the bot on the commandline, run:
```
make run
```

To train the comparison models for the experiments from our paper, run:
```
make train-compare
```

To evaluate these models, run:
```
make evaluate-compare
```
