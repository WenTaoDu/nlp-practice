# DevastateMini

Based on [Devastate](https://github.com/vlakarados/devastate) sublime theme that
was based on [Spacefunk](https://github.com/Twiebie/ST-Spacefunk). Icons is 
taken from [boXY](https://github.com/oivva/boxy).

Tabs and status line appearence were changed to be minimal as possible. This is
especially handy while working on laptop. Selection and comments in color scheme
were changed to be more visible.

It is especially good to use this theme with menu hidden (hackers way =) if you
are Linux user.
