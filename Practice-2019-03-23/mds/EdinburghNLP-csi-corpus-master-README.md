## Annotation Format

Each file contains the screenplay corresponding to one CSI episode (identified 
in the title), one word per line. It contains the following annotations in 
tab-separated columns

- CaseID: indicates which case the sentence is relevant to (some
episodes cover two cases)

- sentID: sentence counter (case specific)

- speaker: speaker of the utterance (None for scene descriptions)

- word: the actual word of the utterance

- killer_gold: binary indicator whether word refers to perpetrator (word-level 
label)

- other_gold: binary indicator whether word refers to any other participant
in the plot (word-level label)

- suspect_gold: binary indicator whether word refers to suspect (word-level label)

- human_guess: human behavioral perpetrator guesses when watching the episode 
for the first time (sentence-level label)

- medion_time: mid-point of video segment corresponding to current sentence

- start_time: start time of video segment corresponding to current sentence

- end_time: end time of video segment corrqesponding to current sentence

- i1_time-i5_time: five equally spaced time points covering video
segment corresponding to current sentence. Audio feature samples were
taken at these points. 

Note that except for the columns 'word', 'killer_gold',
'suspect_gold', and 'other_gold' all labels are provided on the
sentence-level (i.e., their values are invariant for words in the same sentence).
