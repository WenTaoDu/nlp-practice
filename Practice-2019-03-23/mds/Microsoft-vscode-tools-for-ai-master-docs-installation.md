## 2. Install the Python extension for Visual Studio Code

This extension automatically installs the [Microsoft Python extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) as a dependency to provide a better experience working with Python. 

- To learn more about Python in Visual Studio Code [see the docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python)
- For a walkthrough of editing, running, and debugging code, see the [Python Hello World Tutorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial)

> **Tip**: Check out the [IntelliCode extension for VS Code (preview)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2006060). IntelliCode provides a set of AI-assisted capabilities for IntelliSense in Python, such as inferring the most relevant auto-completions based on the current code context.

## 3. Azure Machine Learning SDK Installation
1. In the bottom-right corner of the window, a notification will appear indicating that the Azure ML SDK is being automatically installed.    A local private Python environment is created that has the Visual Studio Code prerequisites for working with Azure Machine Learning.
