# Data Visualization with D3

These are the companion files to the "Data Visualization with D3" course on Udacity.  They are organized according to lesson.  Also included at the bottom of the page are additional resources and links.

## Getting Started

To get started with these code examples remember that we need to setup a local web server.  The code files all assume that you start your web server in this top level directory to serve all files.  If you do not use this folder as the root directory for the web server, be aware that the file paths in the exercise will need to be changed.

To start python's built in web server on `localhost:8888`:

```bash
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

To stop the server navigate to the terminal window it is running in and `Control-C` quit the process.

Once the server is running, navigate to `http://localhost:8888` in your web browser to view the code.

## Contents

* [data](data): Folder containing all of the data files
* [d3.min.js](d3.min.js): The D3.js library.  This file is linked to in all of the code files.
* [L0_template.html](L0_template.html): A blank HTML template with the necessary boilerplate to use as a starting place.
* [L1_code_snippets.html](L1_code_snippets.html): A mock HTML file of the Lesson 1 exercise.  All of the commands are in a script tag, but they are meant to interactive be run in Chrome's developer tools console.
* [L2_basic_charts.html](L2_basic_charts.html): The completed Dimple.js file from Lesson 2 of the scatter + line chart of our World Cup data.
* [L3_annotated_chart.html](L3_annotated_chart.html): The completed D3.js scatter + line chart from Lesson 3 with added annotations and legend.
* [L4_globe.html](L4_globe.html): The completed interactive map from Lesson 4.
* [L5_extra.html](L5_extra.html): An more advanced version of Lesson 4's world map exercise.  Uses [Zoom to Bounding Box](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/9656675) and [two way interaction](http://stackoverflow.com/a/11211391) to enable a drill down narrative with tooltips.
